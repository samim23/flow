## Why Flow?

Blogging is one of the most valuable practices for developing ideas and sharing knowledge. While there are many platforms available, most are either too complex (WordPress), too limiting (Medium), or require too much setup (static site generators).

I wanted something simpler: A lightweight engine with a built-in editor that makes publishing frictionless and focuses on readability. A tool for maintaining a digital garden that grows over time.

That's why I built Flow - a minimalist blogging engine that gets out of your way and lets you focus on what matters: writing and sharing ideas. _Flow is Powering [samim.io](https://samim.io)_

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samim23/flow.git
cd flow
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

1. Setup environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
vim .env (or use your favorite text editor to adjust site config)
source .env
```

2. Run the server:

```bash
python3 flow.py
```

3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:2323/` to start creating content

## Publishing via FTP

In your .env config set `server_ftp_enabled=true` and add your server infos.

## About Page Setup

Create a post in the UI and then rename the file in your `/content/p/` folder to `about.md`

## Cache Management

Flow uses intelligent caching to minimize build times by only regenerating changed content. If you need to manually clear the cache, here are the available commands:

```bash
# Clear specific caches
python flow.py clear-cache --tags            # Clear tag pages
python flow.py clear-cache --archives        # Clear archive pages
python flow.py clear-cache --tag-archives    # Clear tag archive pages
python flow.py clear-cache --posts           # Clear post pages

# Clear multiple caches
python flow.py clear-cache --tags --archives # Clear tags and archives
python flow.py clear-cache --all             # Clear everything
```

## Preview Mode

Add `?freeze=1` to any URL to preview how it will look when published.

## Analytics

Configure your analytics by editing `/static/js/analytics.js`.

## Customizing Posts with Frontmatter

Flow supports special frontmatter fields in your Markdown (`.md`) files to customize how individual posts are rendered and styled:

### Server-Side Markdown Rendering

By default, content in `.md` files is treated as HTML. To enable server-side Markdown parsing (which supports standard Markdown syntax, tables, math rendering with MathJax, etc.), add the following to your post's frontmatter:

```yaml
render_as_markdown: true
```

When this is set, the content of your post (after the `---` frontmatter block) will be processed as Markdown.

Flow's Markdown processor supports the full range of standard Markdown syntax, including:

- **Text Formatting**: Bold with `**double asterisks**` or `__double underscores__`,
  italic with `*single asterisks*` or `_single underscores_`
- **Headers**: Created with `#` at the beginning of a line
- **Lists**: Both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet) lists
- **Links**: `[Link text](URL)`
- **Images**: `![Alt text](image-url)`
- **Tables**: Standard Markdown table format
- **Code Blocks**: Both inline with backticks and fenced code blocks
- **Math**: LaTeX-style math expressions with MathJax
- **HTML**: You can mix HTML with Markdown when needed

### Per-Post Custom CSS Class

To apply a custom CSS class to the main content wrapper of a specific post, allowing for unique styling (e.g., a different font), add the following to the frontmatter:

```yaml
custom_css_class: "your-custom-class-name"
```

For example:

```yaml
custom_css_class: "text-serif"
```

This class will be added to the `div` that wraps your post's content, which you can then target in your CSS files.

### Subdirectory Deployment

If you need to deploy this application in a subdirectory on your server (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/blog/` instead of `https://yourdomain.com/`), you can use the `site_path_prefix` setting in your `.env` file (or `app/settings.py`).

*   **`SITE_URL`**: Set this to your main domain, e.g., `SITE_URL="https://yourdomain.com"`.
*   **`SITE_PATH_PREFIX`**: Set this to the subdirectory path, e.g., `SITE_PATH_PREFIX="/blog/"`. Ensure it starts and ends with a slash, or is just `/` if deploying at the root.

The application will then correctly generate all URLs (for static assets, internal links, RSS feeds, etc.) to include this prefix.

**Note for Live Server (FastAPI):**
When running the live FastAPI server (e.g., via `python app/main.py`), the `root_path` for the FastAPI application is automatically configured based on `SITE_PATH_PREFIX`. This ensures that the live server also operates correctly from the specified subdirectory.
